# To-Do List
- [Russian] Add more advancements translations and remove the #PLACEHOLDER# entries and fill them with something
- [Russian] Refactor Survivor's Guidebook and fix minor GT/DeepL AI translation errors in some texts.
- [Russian] Fix $(br2) text breaks and "text flight in the air" on all pages.

NOTE: 
	- At the moment this translation pack is WIP. To get the localization you need to replace files that you downloaded, however there are a Reverter archive which reverts all Translation Pack changes in case something becomes broken.
